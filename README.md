Welcome to my dbt template project!

This is mainly for my own use when setting up new dbt projects to have some basics ready to use. 
And to have a place to store my macros and examples of how I have solved problems in the past. 


### Reminders:
- source /Users/eflacke/dbt-env/bin/activate
- cd /Users/eflacke/dbt-env/dbt/my_dbt_project
